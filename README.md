## Project Overview
**AuraGuard** _is a wearable safety wristband(system) designed to protect children in crowded or open spaces or indoors by maintaining a secure Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) proximity link between a parent and child. When the child moves beyond a predefined distance (based on signal strength), the parent’s wristband immediately vibrates to alert them._
